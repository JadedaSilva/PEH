<h1>Practical Ethical Hacker</h1>
Firstly if you are going to do the PJPT then everything in the PEH is all you need. If you are going to follow up with the PNPT then it is recommended that you do.

2. Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) Fundamentals
3. External Pentest Playbook

Optional courses, which may add value, include:
